Reflection
Week 3

On this week, it was so great. I was really fascinated from the lecture about “Meadow” and “Earthquake”. I could realized that a statistical analysis have an effect on the different studies. From the lecture by Eric Berlow, I could get an insight into the new field, the ecology with the statistical analysis. Especially, we focused on the prediction the meadow with lots of variables through several types of methods, such as GLM, GAM, etc. Even I’ve never had interest and learned those study, it led me to search more references and articles. 

In addition, the lecture by Prof. Stark was also perfect to refresh my memories (i.e. t-tests, permutation test, ANOVA test, and etc.). With the “Earthquake” problem, we learned how the tests are constructed, and how to analyze with the real data. Since I have took the Stat 135 class long time ago, however, I feel need to prepare the basic materials before we go on. 

On Friday morning, I really thanks to GSIs that tried to install and fix up the Linux. Due to Window 8 and disk volume, however, we couldn’t install it. I think I need to solve this situation, as soon as possible on this weekend.
